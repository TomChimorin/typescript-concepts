# Generics 

## Description

In TypeScript, generics allow you to create reusable components that can work with a variety of types.

Generics make it possible for you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with different data types without having to duplicate code.

## Hello World of Generics

To start off, let’s do the “hello world” of generics: the identity function. The identity function is a function that will return back whatever is passed in. You can think of this in a similar way to the echo command.

Without generics, we would either have to give the identity function a specific type:

```ts
function identity(arg: number): number {
  return arg;
}
```
Or, we could describe the identity function using the `any` type:

```ts
function identity(arg: any): any {
  return arg;
}
```
